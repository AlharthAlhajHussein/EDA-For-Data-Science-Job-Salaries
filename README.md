## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the "Data Science Job Salaries" dataset. As part of my work with **SHAI For AI | شاي للذكاء الاصطناعي**, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of data science salaries to uncover trends, factors, and regional disparities influencing compensation in this field.

The goal of this analysis is to provide valuable insights into salary distribution across various experience levels, job roles, and geographic regions, helping both individuals and organizations make informed decisions in the growing data science industry.
